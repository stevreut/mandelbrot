# Description

This repository contains code to enable generation of images of sections of the
fractal Mandelbrot Set (see below).  Users of the resulting interface can zoom in on 
increasingly smaller and more detailed sections of this set and can select what
region to zoom in on simply by clicking on the displayed image of the set.

## The Mandelbrot Set

![Mandelbrot Set as generated by this software](/images/md/mandelbrot-440.png)

The Mandelbrot Set is a mathematical object which is a subset of the set of complex
numbers (numbers of the form x+y**i** where **i** is the number such that **i**<sup>2</sup> = -1).  This set was first extensively researched and brought to
wide public attention by [Beno&#238;t Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot). It is defined as the set of all complex
numbers c such that infinite repetition of the rule z &#8592; z<sup>2</sup>+c does not diverge when z is given an initial value of zero.

Mandelbrot's work in the 1970s coincided with the first time in history when computers
had become widely available to mathematicians.  Even so, the computing power originally available to him only allowed the [most primitive of images](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/217537/the-first-published-picture-of-the-mandelbrot-set) to be generated
at first.  Still, even this at-first primitive computing power had given Mandelbrot
a huge advantage over his predecessors [Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_Julia) and [Fatou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Fatou).

Julia had discovered the complex sets now known as Julia sets and which were a sort of predecessor to the Mandelbrot set, there being a strong relationship between the two,
though Julia had never had access to computing tools which might have enabled him to
generate detailed images of these sets, though they can be easily generated today.  ([Paul Bourke's Julia set images](https://paulbourke.net/fractals/juliaset/)).  

Aside from having a simple but rather technical definition, the Mandelbrot Set has also become increasingly well known for its visual beauty and infinite complexity
which is in contrast to the relative simplicity of its definition, as demonstrated
in the [famous cover art](https://miriam-english.org/files/Dewdney_Mandelbrot/Dewdney_Mandelbrot.html) for the August 1985 issue of *Scientific American* magazine. Its iconic image has become symbolic of the study of fractals, iterative functions, and 
chaotic dynamics.

# Technologies

This project, thus far, is created with:

- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML
- Canvas

(Incorporation of other technologies in future revisions is likely.)

# Installation

As, for now, this is a strictly front-end implementation, all that is necessary is:

- Select the green **"<span style="color:#ffffff;background-color:#008000"><> Code â–¼</span>"** button on this repository's landing page [github.com/mandelbrot/mandelbrot](https://github.com/stevreut/mandelbrot).

- From the drop-down, select "Download ZIP".

- Save the resulting `mandelbrot-main.zip` file to the location of your choice (preferably into an *empty* folder/directory).

- Unpack the `mandelbrot-main.zip` file using the zip/unzip utility appropriate for your platform.


# Usage

This code has been deployed to site [stevreut.github.io/mandelbrot/](https://stevreut.github.io/mandelbrot/) where it can be viewed and used with any canvas-enabled browser.

# Design and Implementation

At the core of the image generation is the use of HTML canvas functionality.  For each
pixel in the canvas element, the corresponding real (x) and imaginary (y) components of a complex number x+y**i** are determined.  This complex number **c** is then repeatedly
subjected to an iteration of z &#8592; z<sup>2</sup>+**c** (with first value of
z being zero) until it either reaches some limiting count or it diverges beyond some reasonable distance from zero.  Since, by its formal definition, a member of the Mandelbrot Set would be determined after showing no divergence after an **infinite**
number of iterations, some more reasonable constraint has to be used.  That being the case, an *Iteration Limit* is provided by the user on the landing page.  The higher this limit is, the more accurate and detailed will be the resulting image, but higher
values of this limit also increase the amount of time needed to generate the image.  This calculation and the imposition of a count limit is emplemented entirely in the
relatively simple *function mandelbrot()* within Javascript file [fractalimggen.js](scripts/fractalimggen.js).

# Future Enhancements

The following are all possible or likely enhancements to this tool:

* Detailed usage/instruction page
* Associated page that demonstrates some of the underlying mathematics:
    * Iterated functions (with demo)
    * Intro to complex numbers (with demo)
    * Mandelbrot and Julia iteration demonstration (with user-enabled demo)
* Enable (optional) input of image parameters
* Show histogram of count frequencies 
* Julia Set mode
* Enable higher-precision calculation
    * Import or write high-precision JS class
* Policing of values in inputs on entry
* Tracking of cursor / boxing of selected image
* Better management of asynchronous processing - ability to stop processing and
perhaps a status bar for images that take more than a few seconds to generate
* Local tracking history of images generated (local storage, cookies)
* [possibly] remote tracking of images generated (would require cloud or other host support)
* Exportable animation generation
* Ability to customize color palette
    * Phase I - simple phase/amplitude/frequence selection
    * Phase II - add customization of individual pixels
    * Phase III - meta-language for precise control (module)
    * Phase IV - allow persistence of palette(s)
* Allow user the ability to define other iterative functions (i.e. generate
images of other iterative fractals besides Mandelbrot and Julia)
* Auxiliary page(s) explaining and **demonstrating** the nature of the Mandelbrot Set
and perhaps related mathematical objects
* React JS [possibly]
